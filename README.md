RescueARescue is a website designed for a non-profit organization dedicated to dog adoption. The goal of this project is to provide the NGO with a platform that increases exposure and social interaction, ultimately helping them grow their dog adoption center.

## Features

- **Dog/Cat Profiles:** Showcase a collection of adorable dogs and cats available for adoption with detailed profiles.
- **Adoption Process:** Provide information on the adoption process, requirements, and how potential adopters can get involved.
- **Contact Form:** Allow users to easily get in touch with the organization for inquiries, volunteering, or adoption.
